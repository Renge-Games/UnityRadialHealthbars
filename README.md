# Ultimate Circular Health Bars Light
A segmented radial health bar shader for Unity URP/HDRP 2019 and up.

This repo is the result of a tutorial I made on circular health bars using shaders. [Available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5h2ClMUguQ). This tutorial also covers some aspects of shaders and shader graph in general.
